## Features

- 🕯️ **Candle Lighting Times** - Accurate times calculated using HebCal (Hebrew Calendar)

## Dedication

This app is dedicated to the loving and blessed memory of my father
**Shmuel Hirsh ben Mordechai Menachem Mendel ז״ל**,
my mother **Betty bas Yechiel ע״ה**,
and my wife's father **Levi ben Ephraim ז״ל**.

May their neshamos continue to rise higher and higher in Gan Eden,
and may they be meilitzei tov for their entire family
and for all of Klal Yisrael.
